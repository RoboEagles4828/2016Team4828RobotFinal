## Creating branches in eclipse to edit on
When editing code at home, make sure to create a new branch so that the master code is not fatally changed. Your branch should branch off of the develop branch.

1. Go to Github and click on the Branch dropdown in the top left
2. Click the develop branch. You are now in the develop branch.
3. Click the branch dropdown again. Type in the name of the branch you want to make and click enter. Usually the name is whatever feature you are implementing.
4. The branch has now been created. Before you can use it, you must pull the repository again by right clicking the project and going to Team > Pull
5. Right click your project and go to Team > Switch To > Other...
6. Open the Remote Tracking folder and click on the branch you just made.
7. Click Checkout as New Local Branch and then click Exit.

Now you can edit to your heart's content!
